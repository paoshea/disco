# DISCO! 🕺

### Spark Spontaneous Social Connections

DISCO! is a revolutionary social discovery platform that brings back the magic of serendipitous encounters in our increasingly digital world.
By facilitating opt-in, proximity-based connections, DISCO! helps you meet like-minded people in your vicinity while maintaining complete control over your privacy and safety.

DISCO! is available on iOS and Android, and is intended for users aged 13 and above.

The name is a placeholder and needs to be updated in due course. Possible alternatives include "Spark" or "HookUps, not fuckups!".

3. View their public profile and shared interests based on mutual privacy settings
4. If both parties express interest, a secure chat opens with progressive information sharing
5. Use our suggested safe meeting spots to arrange your meetup
6. After meeting, both users provide feedback to maintain community quality
