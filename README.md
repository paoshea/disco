# DISCO! 🕺

### Spark Spontaneous Social Connections

DISCO! is a revolutionary social discovery platform that brings back the magic of serendipitous encounters in our increasingly digital world. By facilitating opt-in, proximity-based connections, DISCO! helps you meet like-minded people in your vicinity while maintaining complete control over your privacy and safety.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Spontaneous Discovery

- Real-time notifications when other DISCO! users who match your interests are nearby
- Smart matching based on shared interests, activities, and social preferences
- Flexible radius settings from 100ft to 1 mile to control your discovery zone

### Privacy First

- Zero personal data storage by default
- End-to-end encrypted communications
- Precise location data is never shared with other users
- Approximate distance indicators only (e.g., "within 500ft")
- Optional verified identity system through trusted third-party providers

### Safety Features

- Meet in public places only - integration with Google Places API to suggest safe meeting spots
- Real-time safety check-ins during meetups
- Emergency contact system with one-tap activation
- Community rating system with mandatory feedback after meetings
- AI-powered content and behavior monitoring

### Smart Filtering

- Customizable interest tags to find people who share your passions
- Activity-based matching (coffee, lunch, quick chat, workspace sharing)
- Time-window preferences (e.g., only during lunch hours)
- Professional mode for networking-focused connections
- Intelligent battery-optimized matching
- Indoor proximity detection via Bluetooth
- Progressive profile visibility controls
- Customizable matching radius (100ft to 1 mile)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download DISCO! from the App Store or Google Play
2. Create your profile with basic interests and preferences
3. Set your discovery preferences:
   - Active radius
   - Time windows
   - Interest categories
   - Meeting preferences
   - Privacy controls
   - Profile visibility settings
4. Enable notifications to receive real-time match alerts
5. Start discovering!

## 💡 How It Works

1. When you're in "discovery mode," the app runs in the background using minimal battery (< 5% daily impact)
2. If another user with matching interests enters your radius, both parties receive a notification within 30 seconds
3. View their public profile and shared interests based on mutual privacy settings
4. If both parties express interest, a secure chat opens with progressive information sharing
5. Use our suggested safe meeting spots to arrange your meetup
6. After meeting, both users provide feedback to maintain community quality
