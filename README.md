## 💡 How It Works

2. If another user with matching interests enters your radius, both parties receive a notification within 30 seconds
3. View their public profile and shared interests based on mutual privacy settings
4. If both parties express interest, a secure chat opens with progressive information sharing
5. Use our suggested safe meeting spots to arrange your meetup
6. After meeting, both users provide feedback to maintain community quality
