# DISCO! 🕺
### Spark Spontaneous Social Connections

DISCO! is a revolutionary social discovery platform that brings back the magic of serendipitous encounters in our increasingly digital world. By facilitating opt-in, proximity-based connections, DISCO! helps you meet like-minded people in your vicinity while maintaining complete control over your privacy and safety.

## 🌟 Key Features

### Spontaneous Discovery
- Real-time notifications when other DISCO! users who match your interests are nearby
- Smart matching based on shared interests, activities, and social preferences
- Flexible radius settings from 100ft to 1 mile to control your discovery zone

### Privacy First
- Zero personal data storage by default
- End-to-end encrypted communications
- Precise location data is never shared with other users
- Approximate distance indicators only (e.g., "within 500ft")
- Optional verified identity system through trusted third-party providers

### Safety Features
- Meet in public places only - integration with Google Places API to suggest safe meeting spots
- Real-time safety check-ins during meetups
- Emergency contact system with one-tap activation
- Community rating system with mandatory feedback after meetings
- AI-powered content and behavior monitoring

### Smart Filtering
- Customizable interest tags to find people who share your passions
- Activity-based matching (coffee, lunch, quick chat, workspace sharing)
- Time-window preferences (e.g., only during lunch hours)
- Professional mode for networking-focused connections

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Download DISCO! from the App Store or Google Play
2. Create your profile with basic interests and preferences
3. Set your discovery preferences:
   - Active radius
   - Time windows
   - Interest categories
   - Meeting preferences
4. Enable notifications to receive real-time match alerts
5. Start discovering!

## 💡 How It Works

1. When you're in "discovery mode," the app runs in the background using minimal battery
2. If another user with matching interests enters your radius, both parties receive a notification
3. View their public profile and shared interests
4. If both parties express interest, a secure chat opens
5. Use our suggested safe meeting spots to arrange your meetup
6. After meeting, both users provide feedback to maintain community quality
