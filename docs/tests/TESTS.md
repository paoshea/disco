# Testing Strategy and Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines our testing strategy, tools, and goals for the Disco application. Our testing approach aims to ensure high-quality code, prevent regressions, and maintain a robust application as we scale.

## Testing Tools and Libraries

### Current Stack

- **Jest** - Primary testing framework

  - Chosen for its extensive feature set, great TypeScript support, and excellent integration with React
  - Provides snapshot testing, code coverage reporting, and parallel test execution
  - Large ecosystem of extensions and matchers

- **React Testing Library**

  - Used for testing React components and hooks
  - Promotes testing best practices by focusing on user behavior rather than implementation details
  - Excellent integration with Jest and TypeScript

- **jest-dom**

  - Extends Jest with custom DOM element matchers
  - Makes assertions about the state of DOM elements more natural and readable

- **Cypress**
  - For end-to-end testing
  - Will help test complete user flows and integration points
  - Provides excellent debugging tools and visual test execution
  - Planned implementation: Q2 2025

### Planned Future Additions

1. **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**

   - For API mocking and testing
   - Will provide consistent API mocking across unit tests and development
   - Planned implementation: Q2 2025

2. **Playwright**
   - For cross-browser testing
   - Will ensure consistent behavior across different browsers
   - Planned implementation: Q3 2025

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure

Tests are organized to mirror the source code structure, with a few key differences:

```
src/
├── __tests__/           # Test files
│   ├── __mocks__/      # Global mocks
│   │   ├── next-auth.ts
│   │   ├── prisma.ts
│   │   ├── redis.ts
│   │   ├── user.ts
│   │   └── localStorage.ts
│   ├── auth/           # Auth-related tests
│   │   ├── useAuth.test.tsx
│   │   ├── session.test.tsx
│   │   └── oauth.test.tsx
│   ├── profile/        # Profile-related tests
│   │   ├── ProfileSettings.test.tsx
│   │   ├── ProfileEdit.test.tsx
│   │   └── profile.service.test.ts
│   ├── hooks/          # Hook tests
│   │   └── useGeolocation.test.ts
│   └── models/         # Model tests
│       └── user.test.ts
└── services/           # Service tests
    ├── event/__tests__/
    │   └── event.service.test.ts
    ├── location/__tests__/
    │   └── location.service.test.ts
    ├── matching/__tests__/
    │   └── match.service.test.ts
    └── preferences/__tests__/
        └── preferences.service.test.ts
```

### Test File Naming

- Test files should be named after the module they test with the `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` extension
- Mock files should be prefixed with `mock` and placed in the appropriate `__mocks__` directory
- Test utilities should be placed in a `__utils__` directory at the appropriate level

### Mock Organization

We maintain several levels of mocks:

1. **Global Mocks** (`src/__tests__/__mocks__/`)

   - User data
   - localStorage
   - Session data
   - API responses

2. **Service-Level Mocks** (`src/services/<service>/__tests__/__mocks__/`)

   - Service-specific mock data
   - Mock implementations

3. **Feature-Level Mocks** (alongside test files)
   - Component-specific props
   - Event handlers
   - Context providers

### Best Practices

1. **Mock Management**

   - Keep mocks close to where they're used
   - Share common mocks through the global `__mocks__` directory
   - Version control mock data for consistency

2. **Test Structure**

   - Group related tests using `describe` blocks
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
   - Mock at the appropriate level (global vs local)

3. **Testing Hooks**

   - Use `renderHook` from `@testing-library/react-hooks`
   - Test all possible states
   - Verify cleanup/unmount behavior
   - Test error conditions

4. **Testing Components**
   - Focus on user interaction
   - Test accessibility
   - Verify error states
   - Check loading indicators

### Recent Changes (January 2025)

1. **Auth Tests Reorganization**

   - Moved auth-related tests to dedicated `auth/` directory
   - Split session management tests from auth hook tests
   - Improved mock implementations for consistency
   - Added comprehensive OAuth integration tests

2. **Service Tests Structure**

   - Standardized service test organization
   - Added dedicated `__tests__` directories per service
   - Improved separation of concerns in test files

3. **Mock Data Management**
   - Centralized common mock data
   - Added type safety to mock implementations
   - Improved mock data versioning

## Running Tests

### Available Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:auth    # Run auth tests

```

## Continuous Integration

- All PRs must pass tests before merging
- Coverage reports are generated for each PR
- Performance benchmarks are tracked
- E2E tests run nightly (future)

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests

1. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. Use meaningful test descriptions
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Keep tests focused and atomic
5. Use appropriate levels of testing (unit, integration, E2E)

### Test Data

1. Use meaningful test data
2. Avoid sharing mutable state between tests
3. Clean up after tests
4. Use fixtures for complex test data
5. Mock external services appropriately

## Future Improvements

1. Implement visual regression testing
2. Add performance testing suite
3. Implement API contract testing
4. Add accessibility testing
5. Implement load testing for critical endpoints

## Monitoring and Reporting

- Weekly test coverage reports
- Performance regression tracking
- Test execution time monitoring
- Flaky test detection and resolution

## Contributing

When adding new features or modifying existing ones:

1. Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
2. Maintain or improve existing test coverage
3. Document test cases and scenarios
4. Review test code with the same rigor as production code
