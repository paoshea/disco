# Testing Strategy and Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines our testing strategy, tools, and goals for the Disco application. Our testing approach aims to ensure high-quality code, prevent regressions, and maintain a robust application as we scale.

## Testing Tools and Libraries

### Current Stack
- **Jest** - Primary testing framework
  - Chosen for its extensive feature set, great TypeScript support, and excellent integration with React
  - Provides snapshot testing, code coverage reporting, and parallel test execution
  - Large ecosystem of extensions and matchers

- **React Testing Library**
  - Used for testing React components and hooks
  - Promotes testing best practices by focusing on user behavior rather than implementation details
  - Excellent integration with Jest and TypeScript

- **jest-dom**
  - Extends Jest with custom DOM element matchers
  - Makes assertions about the state of DOM elements more natural and readable

### Planned Future Additions

1. **Cypress**
   - For end-to-end testing
   - Will help test complete user flows and integration points
   - Provides excellent debugging tools and visual test execution
   - Planned implementation: Q2 2025

2. **Mock Service Worker (MSW)**
   - For API mocking and testing
   - Will provide consistent API mocking across unit tests and development
   - Planned implementation: Q2 2025

3. **Playwright**
   - For cross-browser testing
   - Will ensure consistent behavior across different browsers
   - Planned implementation: Q3 2025

## Test Coverage Goals

  - [ ] Privacy settings

- [ ] Safety Features
  - [ ] User blocking
  - [ ] Report system
  - [ ] Content moderation
  - [ ] Emergency contacts

- [ ] Location Services
  - [ ] Location sharing
  - [ ] Geofencing
  - [ ] Location history
  - [ ] Privacy controls

- [ ] Matching System
  - [ ] Match algorithm
  - [ ] Preferences management
  - [ ] Match filtering
  - [ ] Match recommendations

### Testing Standards
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Minimum 80% code coverage for new features
   - All utility functions must have unit tests
   - All hooks must have comprehensive tests
   - All reducers and state management must be tested

2. **Integration Tests**
   - All critical user flows must have integration tests
   - API integration points must be tested
   - Error handling must be tested
   - State management integration must be tested

3. **End-to-End Tests** (Future)
   - All critical user journeys must have E2E tests
   - Cross-browser compatibility must be verified
   - Performance benchmarks must be maintained

## Test Organization

### Directory Structure
```
src/
├── __tests__/           # Jest tests
│   ├── auth/           # Authentication tests
│   ├── components/     # Component tests
│   ├── hooks/         # Hook tests
│   └── utils/         # Utility function tests
├── e2e/               # End-to-end tests (future)
└── integration/       # Integration tests (future)
```

### Naming Conventions
- Test files: `*.test.tsx` or `*.test.ts`
- Test utilities: `*.test.utils.ts`
- Test fixtures: `*.fixtures.ts`
- Mock data: `*.mocks.ts`

## Running Tests

### Available Commands
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:auth    # Run auth tests
npm run test:ui      # Run UI component tests
```

## Continuous Integration
- All PRs must pass tests before merging
- Coverage reports are generated for each PR
- Performance benchmarks are tracked
- E2E tests run nightly (future)

## Best Practices

### Writing Tests
1. Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
2. Use meaningful test descriptions
3. Test edge cases and error conditions
4. Keep tests focused and atomic
5. Use appropriate levels of testing (unit, integration, E2E)

### Test Data
1. Use meaningful test data
2. Avoid sharing mutable state between tests
3. Clean up after tests
4. Use fixtures for complex test data
5. Mock external services appropriately

## Future Improvements
1. Implement visual regression testing
2. Add performance testing suite
3. Implement API contract testing
4. Add accessibility testing
5. Implement load testing for critical endpoints

## Monitoring and Reporting
- Weekly test coverage reports
- Performance regression tracking
- Test execution time monitoring
- Flaky test detection and resolution

## Contributing
When adding new features or modifying existing ones:
1. Write tests before implementing features (TDD approach)
2. Maintain or improve existing test coverage
3. Document test cases and scenarios
4. Review test code with the same rigor as production code

This document will be updated as our testing strategy evolves and new tools or practices are adopted.
