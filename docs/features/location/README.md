# Location-Based Features

This document outlines the core location and proximity features of the Disco platform.

## Overview

The location system combines GPS and Bluetooth technologies to provide accurate positioning both outdoors and indoors, while maintaining battery efficiency and user privacy.

## Core Components

### 1. Location Services

#### GPS Location Tracking
- Battery-optimized background location updates
- Configurable update intervals based on user activity
- Geofencing for privacy zones
- Accuracy levels: high (10m), medium (50m), low (100m)

#### Bluetooth Proximity
- Indoor positioning using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
- Mesh networking for improved accuracy
- Privacy-preserving device identification
- Range: up to 100m outdoors, 30m indoors

### 2. Privacy Zones

#### Configuration
- User-defined privacy zones (home, work, etc.)
- Automatic location masking in sensitive areas
- Customizable radius (100m - 1km)
- Temporary privacy zones for ad-hoc locations

#### Implementation
- Geofence monitoring
- Real-time zone entry/exit notifications
- Background zone updates
- Zone sharing controls

## Technical Implementation

### Location Manager

```typescript
interface LocationManager {
  // Core location tracking
  startTracking(): Promise<void>;
  stopTracking(): Promise<void>;
  getCurrentLocation(): Promise<Location>;
  
  // Privacy zones
  addPrivacyZone(zone: PrivacyZone): Promise<void>;
  removePrivacyZone(zoneId: string): Promise<void>;
  
  // Bluetooth proximity
  startBluetoothScanning(): Promise<void>;
  stopBluetoothScanning(): Promise<void>;
  getNearbyDevices(): Promise<ProximityDevice[]>;
}
```

### Battery Optimization

## Privacy & Security

### Data Protection
- End-to-end encryption of location data
- Temporary location caching
- Secure proximity token exchange
- Anonymous device identifiers

### User Controls
- Granular permission settings
- Temporary location sharing
- Privacy mode toggles
- Data retention policies

## Integration Points

### 1. Matching Service
