By following these next steps, we can ensure the Disco application is feature-complete, robust, and well-documented.

### New Priority: Review /lib and src/lib Directories

#### Goals
- Identify and eliminate duplications
- Consolidate functionality for clarity
- Improve maintainability

#### Issues Identified

1. **Duplicated Files:**
   - `prisma.ts` exists in both `/lib` and `src/lib/db/client.ts`
   - `rateLimit.ts` exists in both directories
   - `utils.ts` exists in both root `/lib` and as utilities in `src/lib/utils/`
2. **Confusing Structure:**
   - API-related files split between `/lib/api.ts` and `src/lib/api/client.ts`
   - Authentication spread across multiple locations

#### Recommended Actions

1. **Consolidate Files:**

   - `src/lib/prisma.ts`: Consolidate Prisma client
   - `src/lib/api/index.ts`: Consolidate API utilities

2. **Organize src/lib into Clear Domains:**

   - Delete `/lib` directory and move all functionality to `src/lib`
   - Organize `src/lib` as follows:
     ```
     src/lib/
       ├── api/         // All API-related code
       ├── auth/        // Authentication utilities
       ├── db/          // Database connections
       ├── email/       // Email functionality
       ├── redis/       // Redis client
       └── utils/       // Shared utilities
     ```

3. **Remove /lib Directory:**
   - Execute `rm -r lib/` to remove the `/lib` directory after consolidation

### Success Criteria

- No duplicated files
- Clear and maintainable directory structure
- All functionality consolidated in `src/lib`

## IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP - Auth Process Flow Enhancement

### Goals

### Aim to standardize on one library as soon as possible to avoid the issues mentioned below.

# Replace jsonwebtoken with jose

Using both `jsonwebtoken` and `jose` in the same project is technically possible, but it's generally not ideal due to potential redundancy, increased bundle size, and confusion about which library to use for specific tasks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### **1. Compatibility and Use Case Differences**

- **`jsonwebtoken`**:

  - A popular library for working with JWTs in Node.js environments.
  - Provides functions like `sign`, `verify`, and `decode`.
  - Heavily relies on Node.js-specific modules like `crypto` and is **not Edge-compatible** (e.g., for Next.js API routes running in the Edge Runtime).

- **`jose`**:
  - A modern library designed to work in both **Node.js and web environments** (e.g., Edge Runtime, browsers).
  - Supports JWTs and other JOSE standards (JWS, JWE, JWK).
  - Works seamlessly with modern web crypto APIs, making it ideal for Next.js applications with serverless or Edge runtime requirements.

### **2. Potential Issues**

- **Redundancy**:

  - Both libraries offer overlapping functionality for handling JWTs, which can lead to confusion about which one to use in specific parts of your code.
  - This also increases your bundle size unnecessarily, especially if you're using both in client-side code.

- **Inconsistent Behavior**:

  - If parts of your codebase rely on `jsonwebtoken` and others on `jose`, subtle differences in API behavior or token verification could lead to bugs or security risks.

- **Edge Runtime Incompatibility**:
  - If you use `jsonwebtoken` in Edge-compatible routes or client-side code, you will encounter runtime errors because `jsonwebtoken` relies on Node.js-specific modules.

### **3. Recommendation**

If you are starting fresh or aiming for compatibility with modern environments (like Edge), **migrate entirely to `jose`**. It is more future-proof and works in all the environments where `jsonwebtoken` might fail.

### **4. How to Replace `jsonwebtoken` with `jose`**

Here’s how common tasks can be done using `jose`:

#### Signing a JWT:

```typescript
import { SignJWT } from 'jose';

async function createToken(payload: object, secretKey: string) {
  const secret = new TextEncoder().encode(secretKey);

  const token = await new SignJWT(payload)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
    .setIssuedAt()
    .setExpirationTime('2h')
    .sign(secret);

  return token;
}
```

#### Verifying a JWT:

```typescript
import { jwtVerify } from 'jose';

async function verifyToken(token: string, secretKey: string) {
  const secret = new TextEncoder().encode(secretKey);

  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, secret);
  return payload; // Decoded payload
}
```

#### Decoding a JWT (without verification):

```typescript
import { decodeJwt } from 'jose';

function decodeToken(token: string) {
  return decodeJwt(token);
}
```

### **5. Migrating Gradually**

If migrating entirely to `jose` isn’t feasible immediately:

- Use `jose` for new code, especially in Edge-compatible routes.
- Plan to replace `jsonwebtoken` in older code incrementally.

### **6. Removing `jsonwebtoken`**

Once the migration is complete, remove `jsonwebtoken` from your `package.json`:

```bash
npm uninstall jsonwebtoken
npm uninstall @types/jsonwebtoken
```

### **7. When to Keep Both**

The only valid reason to use both libraries would be:

- Legacy code relies on `jsonwebtoken`, and refactoring it is currently impractical.
- New parts of the project require Edge compatibility, where `jose` is used.

## Spontaneous Social Engagement Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Core Location & Privacy Foundation

1. Privacy-focused location processing

   - Essential for user trust and data protection
   - Foundation for all location-based features
   - Must be implemented before any location features go live

2. Profile visibility controls

   - Allow users to control what potential matches can see
   - Set up granular privacy settings
   - Enable temporary profile visibility options

3. Flexible radius settings (100ft to 1 mile)
   - Core functionality for defining "nearness"
   - User-configurable proximity thresholds
   - Integration with existing geohashing system

### Phase 2: Matching & Filtering

4. Interest-based matching

   - Define interest categories and tags
   - Implement matching algorithm weights
   - Create interest-based filtering UI

5. Activity-based filtering
   - Time-window preferences
   - Activity type matching
   - Availability status system

### Phase 3: Real-time Notifications

6. Push notification system

   - Near-match notifications
   - Chat request alerts
   - Safety check notifications
   - Custom notification preferences

7. Battery-optimized background location
   - Intelligent location update intervals
   - Geofencing optimization
   - Battery usage monitoring
   - Background task management

### Phase 4: Enhanced Proximity Features

8. Bluetooth proximity enhancement

   - Short-range precise matching
   - Battery-efficient proximity detection
   - Indoor location enhancement

9. Contact information sharing settings
   - Progressive information disclosure
   - Mutual match information sharing
   - Temporary contact sharing options

### Success Criteria for Each Phase

- Phase 1: Users can safely share location and control visibility
- Phase 2: Users are matched based on compatible interests and activities
- Phase 3: Users receive timely notifications about potential matches
- Phase 4: Enhanced proximity detection and secure information sharing

### Dependencies

- Phase 1 must be completed before any other phases
- Phase 2 can begin once basic privacy controls are in place
- Phase 3 requires completion of Phase 1
- Phase 4 can run in parallel with Phase 3

### Metrics for Success

- Battery impact < 5% per day
- Match notification latency < 30 seconds
- False positive matches < 10%
- User privacy control satisfaction > 90%
