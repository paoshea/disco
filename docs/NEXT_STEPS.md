### Aim to standardize on one library as soon as possible to avoid the issues mentioned below.

# Replace jsonwebtoken with jose

Using both `jsonwebtoken` and `jose` in the same project is technically possible, but it's generally not ideal due to potential redundancy, increased bundle size, and confusion about which library to use for specific tasks. Here's a detailed breakdown:

### **1. Compatibility and Use Case Differences**
- **`jsonwebtoken`**:
  - A popular library for working with JWTs in Node.js environments.
  - Provides functions like `sign`, `verify`, and `decode`.
  - Heavily relies on Node.js-specific modules like `crypto` and is **not Edge-compatible** (e.g., for Next.js API routes running in the Edge Runtime).

- **`jose`**:
  - A modern library designed to work in both **Node.js and web environments** (e.g., Edge Runtime, browsers).
  - Supports JWTs and other JOSE standards (JWS, JWE, JWK).
  - Works seamlessly with modern web crypto APIs, making it ideal for Next.js applications with serverless or Edge runtime requirements.

### **2. Potential Issues**
- **Redundancy**: 
  - Both libraries offer overlapping functionality for handling JWTs, which can lead to confusion about which one to use in specific parts of your code.
  - This also increases your bundle size unnecessarily, especially if you're using both in client-side code.

- **Inconsistent Behavior**:
  - If parts of your codebase rely on `jsonwebtoken` and others on `jose`, subtle differences in API behavior or token verification could lead to bugs or security risks.

- **Edge Runtime Incompatibility**:
  - If you use `jsonwebtoken` in Edge-compatible routes or client-side code, you will encounter runtime errors because `jsonwebtoken` relies on Node.js-specific modules.

### **3. Recommendation**
If you are starting fresh or aiming for compatibility with modern environments (like Edge), **migrate entirely to `jose`**. It is more future-proof and works in all the environments where `jsonwebtoken` might fail.

### **4. How to Replace `jsonwebtoken` with `jose`**

Here’s how common tasks can be done using `jose`:

#### Signing a JWT:
```typescript
import { SignJWT } from 'jose';

async function createToken(payload: object, secretKey: string) {
  const secret = new TextEncoder().encode(secretKey);

  const token = await new SignJWT(payload)
    .setProtectedHeader({ alg: 'HS256' })
    .setIssuedAt()
    .setExpirationTime('2h')
    .sign(secret);

  return token;
}
```

#### Verifying a JWT:
```typescript
import { jwtVerify } from 'jose';

async function verifyToken(token: string, secretKey: string) {
  const secret = new TextEncoder().encode(secretKey);

  const { payload } = await jwtVerify(token, secret);
  return payload; // Decoded payload
}
```

#### Decoding a JWT (without verification):
```typescript
import { decodeJwt } from 'jose';

function decodeToken(token: string) {
  return decodeJwt(token);
}
```

### **5. Migrating Gradually**
If migrating entirely to `jose` isn’t feasible immediately:
- Use `jose` for new code, especially in Edge-compatible routes.
- Plan to replace `jsonwebtoken` in older code incrementally.

### **6. Removing `jsonwebtoken`**
Once the migration is complete, remove `jsonwebtoken` from your `package.json`:
```bash
npm uninstall jsonwebtoken
npm uninstall @types/jsonwebtoken
```

### **7. When to Keep Both**
The only valid reason to use both libraries would be:
- Legacy code relies on `jsonwebtoken`, and refactoring it is currently impractical.
- New parts of the project require Edge compatibility, where `jose` is used.
