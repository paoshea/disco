  - [ ] Accuracy vs. battery trade-offs
  - [ ] Edge case handling
  - [ ] Cross-device testing

### 4. Matching System
Rationale: Core feature requiring solid foundation in auth, safety, and location.

#### Algorithm Enhancement
- [ ] Basic matching implementation
  - [ ] Interest matching refinement
  - [ ] Activity compatibility logic
  - [ ] Time window optimization
  - [ ] Historical pattern analysis

  - [ ] Connection stability
  - [ ] Reconnection logic
  - [ ] Error recovery
  - [ ] Load balancing

#### Notifications
- [ ] Push notification system
  - [ ] Service worker setup
  - [ ] Notification permissions
  - [ ] Custom notification types
  - [ ] Action handlers

#### Chat System
- [ ] Core chat functionality
  - [ ] Message delivery
  - [ ] Read receipts
  - [ ] Media sharing
  - [ ] Chat history

#### Presence System
- [ ] Online status management
  - [ ] Presence detection
  - [ ] Status updates
  - [ ] Privacy controls
  - [ ] Offline handling
