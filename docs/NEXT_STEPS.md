### File reorganisation

some suggestions for improvement:

- Type Safety:
  Some any types in the codebase
  Inconsistent use of generics
  Recommendation:
  Remove all any types, Remove any types causing TypeScript errors
  Use proper TypeScript generics consistently, Fix inconsistent generics that are causing build errors
  Add proper return types to all functions, Add missing return types that TypeScript is complaining about
- API Client Duplication: There are multiple API client implementations:
  /lib/api.ts using native fetch
  /src/lib/api/client.ts using Axios
  /src/services/api/api.ts also using Axios
  Recommendation: Consolidate these into a single API client implementation, preferably using Axios for better error handling and interceptors.
  Since we're getting errors related to API calls and auth, we should consolidate the API clients
  This will fix the current build errors in the auth and notification services
- Authentication Flow:
  Need to fix the immediate token/auth related errors. Currently, mixing Next-Auth with custom token-based auth
  Token storage in localStorage which isn't secure for sensitive data
  Recommendation:
  Use Next-Auth consistently with JWT session strategy
  Store tokens in HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage
  Focus on making the current auth approach work consistently before migrating to a new strategy
- State Management:
  Current mix of Context and Zustand works, just not ideal
  Multiple state management approaches (Context, Zustand store)
  Some components directly accessing localStorage
  Recommendation:
  Can gradually migrate to Zustand over time
  Use Zustand consistently for global state
  Create separate stores for different domains (auth, preferences, notifications)
  Access localStorage only through store actions
- Error Handling:
  Inconsistent error handling across services. Can be improved gradually.
  Current inconsistency doesn't prevent builds.
  Some services throw raw errors, others return error objects
  Recommendation:
  Create a consistent error handling strategy
  Use custom error classes with proper typing
  Implement global error boundary
- Service Organization:
  Current structure works, just not optimal. Can be refactored gradually without breaking changes.
  Services are spread across different patterns:
  /src/services/api/_
  /src/services/preferences/_
  /lib/\*
  Recommendation:
  Follow domain-driven design
  Organize services by feature rather than technical concern
  Move all services under /src/services/[domain]
- Middleware:
  Both implementations are functional. Can be unified later as part of architectural improvement.
  Multiple middleware implementations:
  /middleware.ts
  /src/middleware/authMiddleware.ts
  Recommendation:
  Consolidate middleware logic
  Use Next.js middleware consistently
  Add proper typing for middleware functions
- WebSocket Services:
  Current implementation works. Improvements can be made later for better reliability.
  Multiple WebSocket service implementations
  Inconsistent connection management
  Recommendation:
  Create a single WebSocket service
  Implement proper reconnection strategy
  Add proper error handling and logging
