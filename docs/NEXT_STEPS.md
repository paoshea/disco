- Features In Progress: 10
- Planned Features: 50
- Completion Percentage: 80%

## Immediate Action Items

- Prioritize user experience improvements
- Maintain test coverage during changes
- Document all API changes
- Monitor performance metrics

## Next Steps
Based on the current state of the project and the implementation checklist below, here is the prioritized sequence of tasks:

### 1. Core Authentication & Security First
Rationale: Authentication is the foundation of user security and needs to be rock-solid before testing other features that depend on it.

#### Authentication Flow
- [ ] Test and fix auth user flows
  - [ ] Registration with email verification
  - [ ] Social auth integration (Google, Apple)
  - [ ] Password reset flow
  - [ ] Session management and refresh tokens
  - [ ] Account deletion process
  - [ ] Email change verification

#### Security Enhancements
- [ ] Complete the migration from jsonwebtoken to jose
  - [ ] Audit current JWT usage
  - [ ] Create migration plan with rollback strategy
  - [ ] Update token signing and verification
  - [ ] Test all auth flows post-migration
  - [ ] Remove old dependencies

#### Error Handling & Rate Limiting
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for auth failures
  - [ ] Standardized error responses
  - [ ] Detailed logging for debugging
  - [ ] User-friendly error messages
- [ ] Add rate limiting for auth endpoints
  - [ ] IP-based rate limiting
  - [ ] User-based rate limiting
  - [ ] Implement exponential backoff

#### Two-Factor Authentication
- [ ] Set up 2FA support
  - [ ] SMS-based verification
  - [ ] Authenticator app integration
  - [ ] Backup codes generation
  - [ ] 2FA recovery process

### 2. Safety Features
Rationale: Critical for user trust and protection in a social platform.

#### Safety Settings System
- [ ] Core safety features implementation
  - [ ] Safety settings configuration UI
  - [ ] Privacy mode transitions
  - [ ] Location sharing controls
  - [ ] Block/report management

#### Emergency Response
- [ ] Emergency contact system
  - [ ] Contact management UI
  - [ ] Verification process
  - [ ] Alert triggers
  - [ ] Notification system

#### Privacy Controls
- [ ] Privacy zones implementation
  - [ ] Zone creation/editing
  - [ ] Location fuzzing
  - [ ] Entry/exit detection
  - [ ] Privacy mode automation

Current gaps to address:
- Basic verification system needs enhancement
- Limited blocking functionality requires expansion
- Missing report reason categorization
- Basic privacy controls need strengthening

### 3. Location Services
Rationale: Foundation for matching system with privacy considerations.

#### Location Tracking
- [ ] Core functionality
  - [ ] Background location updates
  - [ ] Battery optimization
  - [ ] Accuracy configurations
  - [ ] Location caching

#### Privacy Features
- [ ] Privacy implementation
  - [ ] Geofencing setup
  - [ ] Privacy zone detection
  - [ ] Location fuzzing algorithms
  - [ ] Data retention policies

#### Testing & Optimization
- [ ] Performance validation
  - [ ] Battery impact analysis
  - [ ] Accuracy vs. battery trade-offs
  - [ ] Edge case handling
  - [ ] Cross-device testing

### 4. Matching System
Rationale: Core feature requiring solid foundation in auth, safety, and location.

#### Algorithm Enhancement
- [ ] Basic matching implementation
  - [ ] Interest matching refinement
  - [ ] Activity compatibility logic
  - [ ] Time window optimization
  - [ ] Historical pattern analysis

#### User Experience
- [ ] Interface improvements
  - [ ] Mutual match indicators
  - [ ] Match action feedback
  - [ ] Undo functionality
  - [ ] Match preferences UI

Current limitations to address:
- Basic interest matching needs improvement

- Time window optimization needed
- Historical success patterns not utilized

### 5. Real-time Features
Rationale: Enhanced user experience features built on core functionality.

#### WebSocket Implementation
- [ ] Connection management
  - [ ] Connection stability
  - [ ] Reconnection logic
  - [ ] Error recovery
  - [ ] Load balancing

#### Notifications
- [ ] Push notification system
  - [ ] Service worker setup
  - [ ] Notification permissions
  - [ ] Custom notification types
  - [ ] Action handlers

#### Chat System
- [ ] Core chat functionality
  - [ ] Message delivery
  - [ ] Read receipts
  - [ ] Media sharing
  - [ ] Chat history

#### Presence System
- [ ] Online status management
  - [ ] Presence detection
  - [ ] Status updates
  - [ ] Privacy controls
  - [ ] Offline handling
